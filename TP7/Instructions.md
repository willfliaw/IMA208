# Tasks:

1. Go through the Delaunay documentation in CGAL and get a basic understanding of what is happening:
   1. 2D link: https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Triangulation_2/index.html
   2. 3D link: https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Triangulation_3/index.html
2. Familiarize with the STL file format - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)
3. Understand the code
4. Include the Delaunay filtering conditions
5. Write the result as an STL file and visualize it using MeshLab - https://www.meshlab.net/

If you are done with generating a shape, try doing the following:

1. Automatically finding the best alpha value
2. Think (and possibly implement) ideas to extend it for point clouds with varying density (Bimba.xyz) - clue: adaptive value for the parameter
